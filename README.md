## Additional material for [*Inland Multi-Ship Trajectory Prediction: A Comparative Study of Graph Neural Network-Based Models*](https://kadnt.github.io/GNN-IV/link_to_paper.html) (Donandt, K. et al., 2025). 
The background of the maps is based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright/en) using tiles from [CartoDB Positron](https://carto.com/attribution). 

### Rhine sections 
The visualization were created using the coastline, fairway, and waterway profile layers of IENC charts, provided by the [Federal Waterways and Shipping Agency](https://www.gdws.wsv.bund.de/DE/startseite/startseite_node.html) and downloaded from [ELWIS](https://www.elwis.de/DE/dynamisch/IENC/). Kilometer marks at the fairway center were added based on fairway boundary data provided by the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute ([BAW](https://www.baw.de/en/)).
- [Middle Rhine section](https://kadnt.github.io/GNN-IV/middle_rhine.html) (Rhine-KM 595.5-610.0)
- [Lower Rhine section](https://kadnt.github.io/GNN-IV/lower_rhine.html) (Rhine-KM 797-811.5)

### Contextual data
Kilometer marks and curvature values at the fairway center, as defined in the paper, were added based on fairway boundary data provided by the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute ([BAW](https://www.baw.de/en/)). Discharge data were provided by the [Federal Waterways and Shipping Agency](https://www.gdws.wsv.bund.de/DE/startseite/startseite_node.html) and made available via the 
Federal Institute of Hydrology ([BfG](https://gcos.dwd.de/DWD-GCOS/EN/nationalpartners/bfg/bfg_node.html).
